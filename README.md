The abundant increase in population has led to improper waste disposal. Cities are now grappling with the problems of high volumes of waste, costs involved, and disposal technologies and methodologies.All of the waste is amassed in a single bin, making it hard to split the waste, dispose of it properly, and reduce air and water pollution.
As the govt. of India has launched a smart city project to utilize the IT-enabled solution, answering to the arousing need to make the city cleaner.Our system provides an IT-based solution to garbage collection providing greater accessibility, planning appropriately for the disposing process, and at the same time enabling the collection of garbage generation data.
